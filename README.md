 This activity is broken down into two deliverables, WeatherPy and VacationPy.
 Part 1: WeatherPy
 
  In this deliverable, you'll create a Python script to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the
 equator. You'll use the citipy Python library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/citipy) , the OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org/api) , and your problem-solving skills to create a representative model of weather across cities. 
 
 Temperature vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot- Discussion about the linear relationship:

Northern Hemisphere: The linear regression equation has a negative correlation coefficient. A negative r-value of -0.8056403494758057 indicating a strong negative correlation (inverse relationship) between latitude and temperature as we traverse across latitude towards northern hemisphere. (As the latitude increases the temperature decreases in northern hemisphere when traversing away from the equator).

Southern Hemisphere: As we traverse towards the equator the temperature increases, indicated by the positive correlation coefficient from the linear equation. A positive r-value of 0.5461146730536784 indicates a positive correlation between the latitude and temperature. (As the latitude increases the temperature increases).

Humidity vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:

Northern and Southern hemisphere: When the latitude increases the humidity also increases. This indicates a positive relationship between the two. The r-value of northern hemisphere is 0.4189355226360897 and for southern hemisphere is 0.3021593755936192. Both northern and southern hemisphere is considered to have a moderate positive correlation between latitude and humidity.

Cloudiness vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:

Northern Hemisphere : As the latitude increases the cloudiness also increases. However, the r-value is 0.17515373016874183 indicates a weak positive correlation between latitude and cloudiness in the northern hemisphere.

Southern Hemisphere : The r-value is 0.31180762939375034. It indicates a moderate positive correlation between latitude and cloudiness in the southern hemisphere.

Wind Speed vs. Latitude Linear Regression Plot:

Northern Hemisphere : The r-value is 0.2272260348175748. The r-value indicates a statistical measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two variables. This indicates a weak positive correlation between latitude and wind speed in northern hemisphere.

Southern Hemisphere : The r-value is -0.18023056513743935 indicates a weak negative correlation between latitude and wind speed in the southern hemisphere.

Part 2: VacationPy
 In this deliverable, you'll use your weather data skills to plan future vacations. Also, you'll use Jupyter notebooks, the
 geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.
After narrowing down, the cities that fit the temperature criteria are given below with the corresponding hotels.
